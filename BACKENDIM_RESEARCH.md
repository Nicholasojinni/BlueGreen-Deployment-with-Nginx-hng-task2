# DevOps Infrastructure & CLI Flow for Backend.im
**Author:** Ojinni Oluwafemi Nicholas  
**Stage:** HNG Internship ‚Äî DevOps Stage 2 Task (B Research)  

---

## 1. Overview
The goal of this research is to design a simple, cost-efficient, and open-source infrastructure that enables developers to push backend code directly to **Backend.im** using the **Claude Code CLI** and other AI-assisted tools ‚Äî with minimal setup and configuration.  

This design focuses on:  
- Simplicity and automation (minimal manual steps).  
- Open-source and cost-free tooling.  
- Seamless developer experience from local environment to deployment.  

---

## 2. Problem Definition
Developers should be able to:  
1. Write backend code locally.  
2. Run a single command like `claude deploy`.  
3. Have the code automatically built, tested, containerized, and deployed to **Backend.im** infrastructure.  

The system must handle the ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù ‚Äî CI/CD, build pipelines, and deployment ‚Äî behind the scenes, while the developer interacts only through the **Claude CLI**.  

---

## 3. Proposed Architecture  

### üîπ Components  
| Layer | Tool | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| **Source Control** | GitHub / GitLab | Version control and CI trigger. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | GitHub Actions / Drone CI | Builds, tests, and deploys the code automatically. |
| **Containerization** | Docker | Packages code for consistent runtime. |
| **Deployment Host** | Backend.im (VM or Docker host) | Runs the deployed container image. |
| **CLI** | Claude Code CLI | Developer interface to trigger deployment. |
| **Config Management** | YAML (`backendim.yaml`) | Defines environment, ports, and deploy instructions. |

---

### üîπ Architecture Flow
1. **Developer** commits code locally and runs `claude deploy`.  
2. **Claude CLI** reads `backendim.yaml` (deployment config).  
3. CLI pushes code to a Git remote (e.g. GitHub).  
4. **CI Pipeline** is triggered automatically.  
5. Pipeline:  
   - Builds Docker image.  
   - Runs unit tests.  
   - Pushes image to a free registry (e.g. Docker Hub / GHCR).  
6. **Deploy Job** (via SSH or API) updates Backend.im server with the new container.  
7. System verifies health via `/healthz` endpoint and confirms success.

## 4. Tools & Frameworks (and Why)

| Tool | Purpose | Why Chosen |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Docker** | Containerization | Simple, portable, open-source runtime. |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD | Free for public repos, integrates easily with Git. |
| **Claude CLI** | Command Interface | AI-assisted workflow automation. |
| **Backend.im Server (Docker Host)** | Deployment Target | Lightweight, requires minimal setup. |
| **Nginx + Certbot** | Reverse Proxy & SSL | Simple, secure, and widely supported. |
| **YAML Config** | Deployment Spec | Human-readable, easy to customize. |

---

## 5. Local Developer Flow

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Clone Repo** | `git clone https://github.com/org/backend-app.git` |
| 2 | **Run Locally** | `docker compose up` |
| 3 | **Configure Deploy** | Edit `backendim.yaml` (ports, env, target). |
| 4 | **Deploy via CLI** | `claude deploy` triggers Git push + CI run. |
| 5 | **Monitor CI** | View logs in GitHub Actions. |
| 6 | **Access App** | Visit live URL on Backend.im after deploy. |

   backendim.yaml                        Build Docker Image
      ‚Üì                                         ‚Üì

      ‚Üì
   Backend.im Server (Pulls new image, restarts container)
      ‚Üì
   /healthz endpoint check ‚Üí Deployment success
```

---

## 7. Minimal Custom Code

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **CLI Wrapper Script** | Extends Claude CLI to parse `backendim.yaml` and trigger Git push + deploy. |
| **Backend Agent** | Lightweight listener on Backend.im that watches for new images and redeploys automatically. |
| **CI Template** | YAML pipeline template (build ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy). |

---

## 8. Cost & Efficiency Considerations
- Use GitHub‚Äôs free CI minutes for public repos.  
- Use Docker Hub‚Äôs free tier for image hosting.  
- Backend.im server can run on a single low-cost VM or EC2 t2.micro instance.  
- Nginx reverse proxy provides free HTTPS with Certbot.  

---

## 9. Summary
This setup achieves a one-command ‚Äúpush-to-deploy‚Äù workflow using open-source tools and minimal configuration.  
The approach is scalable, easy to replicate, and fully automated.
